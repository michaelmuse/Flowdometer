    <description>A classification attribute that enables sorting object-field trackers into subtypes to facilitate differentiated goal assignment.</description>

    <inlineHelpText>OPTIONAL: Type should be blank unless you plan on having different goal times for different Types of this object (eg: New Business vs Renewal Opportunities may expect different sales cycle times). 

If so, put the API Name of the field youâ€™re using to identify these types here in the Type field. If you need to combine two or more fields to get all Type permutations, you can build a formula field to concatenate them, and pass that in here. Use API Name here, so for custom fields, it should end with &quot;__c&quot;</inlineHelpText>
