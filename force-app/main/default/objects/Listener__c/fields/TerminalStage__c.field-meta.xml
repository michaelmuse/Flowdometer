Hides final stages from overwheliming your reports (since they stay there indefinitely).

Create (or find) a formula field on the tracked object that returns true if your tracked field is in last step of your process. For example, for Leads there is a Standard Field called IsConverted, for Opportunities and Cases, IsClosed. Add all final stage options, such as Cancelled, Lost, etc. 

Specify this field with the API Name, here in Terminal Stage.</inlineHelpText>
