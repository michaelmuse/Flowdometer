Security Scanner Exemption Explanation
====================================

Flowdometer does not require security scanner reports for the following reasons:

1. No External Integrations
--------------------------

- No external callouts or web services are implemented
- No API endpoints are exposed
- No integration with external systems or services

2. No Web Application Components
------------------------------
- No custom web applications or web services are included
- No custom UI components that would require web security scanning
- All user interface elements are built using standard Salesforce components
- No custom JavaScript or web technologies that would require scanning

3. Platform-Only Implementation
-----------------------------
- Solution is implemented using native Salesforce technologies:
  * Apex classes with sharing rules
  * Standard Salesforce Flows
  * Custom objects and fields
  * Standard Lightning components
- All code execution is contained within Salesforce's security context
- No custom web servers or external services are utilized

4. Security Measures in Place
---------------------------
- All classes implement 'with sharing' to enforce organization-wide sharing rules
- SOQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Field-level security checks using Schema.Describe
- Proper access control through Salesforce's built-in security model
- Comprehensive test coverage for security scenarios

5. Compliance with Salesforce Security Best Practices
--------------------------------------------------
- Follows Salesforce security best practices for Apex development
- Implements proper error handling without exposing sensitive information

Conclusion
---------
Given that Flowdometer:
- Operates entirely within the Salesforce Platform
- Contains no external integrations or callouts
- Implements no custom web applications or services
- Uses only native Salesforce technologies
- Follows Salesforce security best practices

Security scanner reports are not required as there are no scannable components that would benefit from web application security scanning.

This exemption is supported by the comprehensive security measures documented in SecurityMeasures.txt, which outlines the security controls implemented within the solution.
