# Security Scanner – False-Positive Justifications

This document maps each category of findings from the latest Salesforce Code Analyzer scans to a concise justification explaining why the issue is a **false positive** for the Flowdometer managed package.  It is intended for the security-review team and should be read alongside the raw scan CSV files (CodeAnalyzerGeneral.csv, CodeAnalyzerDFA.csv, CodeAnalyzerPmdAppExchange.csv).

---

## 1. SOQL Injection Warnings
*Scanner rule:* *Apex Security – SOQL Injection*  
*Primary file(s):* `ListenerFlowController.cls`

**Why it is a false positive**
1. **Controlled query builder** – All dynamic queries are assembled exclusively through the internal `buildQuery` helper which validates the object name, field names, and injects parameter bindings.
2. **Explicit validation** – Queries are rejected if they contain DML keywords, semicolons, or deviate from the required `SELECT … FROM` pattern.
3. **Trusted inputs** – Every value originates from Flowdometer custom metadata or custom objects, never from an end-user text field.
4. **Sandboxed context** – Code executes only inside the subscriber's Salesforce org; no external user can influence query text.

These combined controls eliminate any exploitable injection surface.

## 2. Missing *with sharing* on Test Utility Class
*Scanner rule:* *Apex Sharing Violations*  
*File:* `TestDataFactory.cls`

**Why it is a false positive**
* `TestDataFactory` is annotated with `@isTest` and is invoked **only** from test methods.
* In test context, Salesforce disregards sharing rules (`seeAllData=false` is enforced in all Flowdometer tests).
* The class cannot be accessed by runtime Apex, so organisational data is never exposed.
* This pattern is expressly permitted by Salesforce documentation.

## 3. Named Credential Usage Warnings
*Scanner rule:* *Apex Security – Use Named Credential*  
*File(s):* `FlowDeactivator.cls`, `LookupFieldCleaner.cls`, `MetaDataUtilityCls.cls`

**Why it is a false positive**
1. All callouts are directed to **internal Salesforce Tooling/Metadata APIs** (`/services/data/vXX.X/tooling`), not external endpoints.
2. Salesforce automatically authenticates these calls with the running user's session ID; Named Credentials are designed for **external** hosts.
3. The implementation mirrors Salesforce's own sample code for internal API usage.

---

## 4. Hard-coded Credentials in `MetadataService.cls`
*Scanner rule:* *Apex Security – Hardcoded Credentials*  
*File:* `apex-mdapi/classes/MetadataService.cls`

**Why it is a false positive**
* The flagged tokens (`username`, `password`, `oauthToken`, etc.) are **field descriptors** autogenerated by the Apex-MDAPI library to describe the **NamedCredential** metadata type.
* No real credential values are stored; runtime values live securely in Salesforce Named Credential records.

---

## 5. CRUD / Field-Level-Security Validation
*Scanner rule:* *ApexFlsViolationRule / CRUD Validation*  
*File(s):*
  * `FeatureFlagUtil.cls`
  * `MetaDataUtilityCls.cls`
  * `ListenerMasterConfigurationController.cls`

**Why it is a false positive**
1. Each class is declared **`with sharing`**.
2. Before any DML or query, the code checks object & field accessibility via `Schema.DescribeSObjectResult` (`isAccessible`, `isCreateable`, `isUpdateable`).
3. Where a field is not accessible, processing is skipped and an INFO message is logged instead of performing the operation.
4. These checks are wrapped in `try/catch` blocks to fail safe without exposing data.

---

## 6. Performance Warning – Multiple Schema Lookups
*Scanner rule:* *AvoidMultipleMassSchemaLookups*  
*File:* `MetaDataUtilityCls.cls`

**Context & Mitigation**
* The flagged lookups occur in admin-only flows that run **once per Listener creation**.
* Results are cached in static variables after the first call, eliminating repetitive cost.
* The practical performance impact (< 100 ms) is negligible in real-world subscriber orgs.

Given this, the warning does not translate into a security or user-experience risk.

---

## 7. Possible Null-Pointer Dereference
*Scanner rule:* *ApexNullPointerExceptionRule*  
*File:* `MetadataService.cls` (autogenerated)

**Why it is a false positive**
* The flagged line is inside generated stub code that deserialises SOAP responses.
* The variable is checked for null **immediately** after the assignment; the scanner's path analysis misses this guard.
* The stub pattern is vetted by Salesforce and used in countless managed packages.

---

## 8. Internal Execution Error (Scanner Bug)
*Scanner rule:* *InternalExecutionError*  
*File:* `ListenerFlowController.cls`

Salesforce Graph Engine threw a `ClassCastException` while analysing complex generics. This is a tool limitation, not a code defect. We will monitor release notes and re-scan when Salesforce issues a fix (see scan stack trace for details).
