Flowdometer Security Measures
============================

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Flowdometer managed package to address common security concerns.

1. CRUD/FLS Checks
------------------
- The main controller class `ListenerFlowController` uses `with sharing` to enforce organization-wide sharing rules
- All field access is done through Schema.Describe calls to validate field existence and accessibility
- The `buildQuery` method validates field names against the Schema before including them in queries
- Field-level security is enforced by using Schema.Describe to check field accessibility before querying

2. SOQL Injection Prevention
---------------------------
- All SOQL queries are constructed using parameterized queries with bind variables
- The `buildQuery` method includes validation checks to prevent injection:
  * Validates object names against Schema.getGlobalDescribe()
  * Validates field names against Schema.Describe
  * Prevents DML operations in queries
  * Checks for suspicious characters or patterns
- Query strings are validated before execution to ensure they start with 'SELECT' and don't contain DML keywords

3. Sharing and Access Control
----------------------------
- All classes use `with sharing` to enforce organization-wide sharing rules
- The main controller is marked as `global with sharing` to ensure proper access control
- Parent record access is controlled through the sharing model
- History record access is restricted to records the user has permission to view

4. External Callout Security
---------------------------
- No external callouts are made in the package
- All operations are performed within Salesforce's security context
- No sensitive data is exposed to external systems

5. Dynamic Apex Safety
---------------------
- Schema.Describe calls are used to validate object and field names
- Dynamic SOQL is only used with validated and sanitized input
- All dynamic queries are constructed with proper security checks
- Field names are validated against Schema before use in queries

6. Method and Class Exposure
---------------------------
- Only necessary methods are marked as `@AuraEnabled` or `@InvocableMethod`
- Global methods are limited to those required for Flow integration
- Test methods are properly marked with `@isTest`
- Internal methods are marked as private where possible
- Sensitive operations are encapsulated in private methods

7. Object and Field Access
-------------------------
- Object access is validated through Schema.Describe
- Field access is controlled through Schema.Describe
- Custom object and field names are properly namespaced
- Field-level security is enforced through Schema checks
- Access to history records is restricted to authorized users

8. Additional Security Measures
-----------------------------
- CPU time limits are monitored and enforced
- Batch processing is implemented to handle large data volumes safely
- Error handling includes proper logging without exposing sensitive information
- Retry mechanisms are implemented with maximum retry limits
- All user input is validated before processing

9. Testing and Validation
------------------------
- Comprehensive test coverage for security scenarios
- Test classes include negative test cases for security
- Sharing rules are tested in test classes
- Field-level security is verified in tests
- Error handling and validation are thoroughly tested
